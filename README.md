## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Angular (used for component structure only; no interactivity or logic)

### What I learned

This challenge helped me structure a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS and practice component-based development with Angular. Although no Angular logic was needed, it gave me a clean, modular way to organize the project.

```html
<ul class="hidden md:flex space-x-6 text-sm nav-items">
  <li><a href="#" class="inline-block pb-1 border-b-2 border-transparent hover:border-green-500 transition-colors duration-300">Home</a></li>
</ul>
```

## Continued development

In future projects, I’d like to integrate actual Angular features such as reusable components with inputs/outputs, state handling, and routing. I’ll also focus on improving accessibility and keyboard navigation.

## Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) – Great reference for responsive and utility-first styling.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) – Helpful for real-world layouts and design practice.
